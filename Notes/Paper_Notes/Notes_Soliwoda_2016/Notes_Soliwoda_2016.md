## Section 03

Most problems related to financial management refer to small-sized family-owned farms. What is needed is "quality improvement" of human and social capital on rural areas(related to skills and qualifications necessary for financial management). To achieve this goals, some measures, mainly lifelong learning programmers for farmers (on-line courses, case studies, virtual farms, etc.), may be implemented.
