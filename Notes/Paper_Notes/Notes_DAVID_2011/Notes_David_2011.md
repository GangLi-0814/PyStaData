## Background and Goal

 **Background**: milk-related food safety -> trade flows from China.

**Goal**: provide an economic assessment of Chinese consumer preferences for food safety verification attributes in UTH milk(Ultra-high temperature, or UHT, milk is ultra-pasteurized milk that comes in sterilized containers).

## Methodology and Data

### Methodology 
Choice experiment approach to evaluate Chinese consumer's willingness to pay(WTP)

- **Five two-level attributes**: price, shelf-life, government certification, third-party (private) certification,  and brand.
- **Experiment Area**: Beijing, Chengdu, Hohhot, Nanjing, Shanghai, Wuhan, and Xi'an.
- **Interviewee**: random in supermarkets and convenience stores, where actual milk purchasing decisions take place.

### Data

7 cities $\times$ 60 observations $\times$ 16 choice sets =  6720 observations.

### Econometric Methods

The random utility model(RUM)

RPL model (Recognition of Prior Learning) relaxes the limitations of the traditional logit by allowing random taste variation within a sample according to a specified distribution.
